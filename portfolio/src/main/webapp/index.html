      <h1>Dylan's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hey! I'm Dylan, and this is my portfolio!</p>
      <p>Here is my github:</p>
      <a href="https://github.com/dsmith35">dsmith35</a>
      <p>I'm from Toronto, Canada and I'm working towards a computer science degree. In my spare time I enjoy biking, playing games (Recently been playing an indie game called Death's Door), and learning about/coding up anything I think is interesting.</p>
      <p>There may be a lack of content on here right now, but I will update this portfolio frequently over the next couple days.</p>
      <p>And here is a picture of my dog lying down on my bed.</p>
      <img src="/images/doggo.jpg" width="400" height="500" />/>
      <p> Alright, that's all for now!</p>
